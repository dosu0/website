Hi, this is the blogging portion of my website. I think talking about my *masterpiece* of
a website would be a great first topic.

I originally created this website using [svelte](https://svelte.dev), and very
quickly regretted it. This was probably because it was my first time using svelte it an
actual project. Anyway, I "migrated" my website to react, more specifically
[next.js](https://nextjs.org), which was something I was more comfortable with.
