I recently made the switch from [Vim](https://www.vim.org) to
[Neovim](https://neovim.io) and if you haven't already, I definitely recommend
that you switch.

# Background Info
Before I compare the two, you should probably know what I'm talking about. Vim
and Neovim are both text editors that specialize in being keyboard heavy. In
fact, you don't need to use your mouse in Vim/Neovim because there's
practically a keybinding for everything.

# Comparison
I personally didn't see any performance changes which is fine but there are a bunch of features that Neovim has that vim doesn't, e.g. terminal emulation.
