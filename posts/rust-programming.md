Rust has a pretty steep learning curve, but once you learn you can easily use import
for most programming applications.

Here are some resources I used to learn Rust:
- [The Official Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- ["Rust By Example"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
- ["Rust Design Patterns"](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/)
